    <h1>Welcome to My Dog's Work in Space</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Dog's Moon Mission</li>
        <li>His Mars Rover</li>
        <li>His Telescope and Stars</li>
        <li>My Black Hole Mysteries</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My dog, **Astro**, is the first dog to travel with me to the moon. ðŸš€ We spent a year conducting research on the lunar surface, and Astro even planted the first paw flag on the moon! ðŸŒ•</p>

    <p>Astro and I also traveled to Mars ðŸŒŒ, where we operated a custom rover that he helped design! Our mission discovered new minerals and evidence of ancient water flows on Mars. We even managed to take some breathtaking pictures of the Martian landscape with Astro's telescope.</p>

    <p>Our most dangerous adventure was exploring a black hole. For one week, Astro and I lived inside a black hole to study time dilation. ðŸŒ€ It was intense, but Astroâ€™s bravery helped us survive and make history!</p>
